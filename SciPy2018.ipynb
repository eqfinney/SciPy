    "analyze numerical data with many-dimensional tables called arrays, and\n",
    "matplotlib (\"Matlab Plot Library\"), which helps visualize data with various\n",
    "plotting tools. We will go through examples of Python code, as well as\n",
    "write our own scripts. At the end of the day tomorrow, we will do a \n",
    "mini-analysis that puts all those skills together.\n",
    "\n",
