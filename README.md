## SciPy 2018 Teen Track Tutorial Curriculum
Author: Emily Quinn Finney

These are the Jupyter notebooks and cleaned data sets I used to teach the 
Teen Track tutorial at the SciPy 2018 conference in Austin, TX 
(https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/648144/). Tutorial notebooks cover 
topics such as program flow, NumPy arrays, functions, and data visualization.

Data sets were obtained from Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/suchitgupta60/imdb-data) and subsequently cleaned for 
straightforward use in the classroom.
